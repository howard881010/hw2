1. compile the c++ code
2. push the button A1 is used to decrease the pre_freq by 10
                   A3 is used to increase the pre_freq by 10
                   A2 is used to confirm the frequency of the wave 
3. compile the python3 code
4. the code FFT.py will output a figure which has two subplots
  (1) the sampled data we get from the filtered wave
  (2) the frequency spectrum of the wave we filtered
