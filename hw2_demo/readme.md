1. compile the c++ code
2. push the button A1 is used to decrease the pre_freq by 10
                   A3 is used to increase the pre_freq by 10
                   A2 is used to confirm the frequency of the wave
3. compile the python3 code and press user_button to generate the triangle wave
4. the code FFT.py will output a figure which has two subplots
  (1) the sampled data we get from the filtered wave
  (2) the frequency spectrum of the wave we filtered
5. use picoscope to measure the triangle wave and filter wave
